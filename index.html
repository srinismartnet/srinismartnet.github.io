                    the Model-View-Controller design pattern, ASP.NET Web API
                    for creating HTTP services, Bootstrap for responsive UI

	<div id="aspnetcore" class="questions">
	 What is Kestrel in ASP.NET Core, and how does it compare to IIS hosting?

Kestrel is the default, lightweight, cross-platform web server included in ASP.NET Core. It can be used as a standalone server or behind a reverse proxy like IIS or Nginx for production scenarios. 
Kestrel is more performant than IIS because it's optimized for modern web workloads, but it's not a full-fledged web server, so IIS or Nginx is recommended for security and advanced hosting features.

When configuring Kestrel in production, it's typically hosted behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or IIS) to handle requests and provide additional security features like SSL termination.

1. How does the ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline work?

ASP.NET Core uses a middleware pipeline to handle requests and responses. Middleware components are executed sequentially, processing requests and returning responses. 
Middleware can either handle a request entirely or pass it to the next component by calling next(). 
Common middleware includes authentication, logging, static file serving, etc. 
The pipeline is configured in the Startup.cs file using the Configure method.

Follow-up:
Use: Adds middleware that can process both requests and responses.
Run: Adds terminal middleware that only processes requests and doesn't call the next middleware.
Map: Branches the middleware pipeline based on the request path.

2.Explain the Dependency Injection (DI) system in ASP.NET Core?

ASP.NET Core has built-in support for Dependency Injection (DI), which helps in managing service lifetimes (singleton, scoped, transient). 
Services are registered in the Startup.ConfigureServices method, and the framework automatically injects them where needed, promoting loose coupling and easier testing.

Follow-up:
For complex object graphs, you'd typically rely on constructor injection or method injection, ensuring dependencies are correctly passed. Custom service lifetimes can be implemented by extending the built-in DI container or using more advanced containers like Autofac.

3. How would you configure and handle multiple environments in ASP.NET Core?

ASP.NET Core provides an environment system via ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT (e.g., Development, Staging, Production). 
You can configure different settings for each environment using environment-specific JSON files like appsettings.Development.json, or by using the IHostingEnvironment service to detect and adjust behavior at runtime.
You can use IConfiguration to load and bind settings from various sources (environment variables, JSON files, etc.) and inject them into services or controllers. 
This supports seamless environment-specific configuration.

4. What are some performance optimization techniques you have used in ASP.NET Core applications?

Response Caching: Use caching to reduce server load and response time (e.g., in-memory or distributed caching).
Compression: Enable response compression middleware (Gzip/Brotli) to reduce payload size.
Pooling Database Connections: Use connection pooling to reduce database connection overhead.
Use Asynchronous Code: To avoid thread blocking, use async patterns.
CDN for Static Files: Offload static content like images, CSS, and JavaScript to a CDN.

5. How does ASP.NET Core handle authentication and authorization?

ASP.NET Core uses authentication schemes like Cookies, JWT Bearer tokens, and OAuth to authenticate users. 
For authorization, ASP.NET Core provides role-based and policy-based authorization, allowing fine-grained access control.

Claims-based Authorization: Works by associating claims with a user's identity.
Policy-based Authorization: Offers more control by defining policies that incorporate requirements like roles, claims, or custom logic to determine if a user can perform a certain action.

6. Can you explain how routing works in ASP.NET Core?

ASP.NET Core uses a routing system to map incoming requests to endpoints (controllers, Razor pages, etc.). 
Routing is typically defined in Startup.Configure, and you can choose between conventional routing (defined routes) and attribute-based routing (route attributes on controllers/actions).

Conventional Routing: Routes are centrally defined in Startup.cs.
Attribute-Based Routing: Routes are applied directly to controllers and action methods, allowing for more fine-grained control.
